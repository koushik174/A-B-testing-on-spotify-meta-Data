# A/B Testing on Spotify: Evaluating the Impact of Release Timing on Song Popularity

### Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate the impact of release timing on the popularity of songs on Spotify. By leveraging historical Spotify data and implementing a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, we were able to analyze song attributes and correlate release timings with song success. The insights drawn from this project provide valuable information for artists, producers, and record labels to optimize their release strategies.

### Features
- **Data Extraction**: Spotify API data collection using AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudWatch for daily automated extraction.
- **Data Transformation**: AWS Glue with Apache Spark for processing and transforming large datasets.
- **Data Storage**: Data warehousing using Snowflake, with automated loading through Snowpipe and incremental ingestion with Snowflake pipes.
- **Visualization**: Interactive data visualizations using Power BI to identify trends and correlations between song popularity and release timing.

### Technologies Used
- **AWS Lambda**: For automating Spotify data extraction.
- **Amazon S3**: For storing both raw and processed data.
- **AWS Glue & Apache Spark**: To clean, normalize, and structure the data.
- **Snowflake & Snowpipe**: For cloud data warehousing and automated data ingestion.
- **Power BI**: For creating insightful visual reports.
- **Spotify API**: As the data source for streaming metrics.
- **Python Libraries**: Spotipy for Spotify API integration, boto3 for AWS service interaction.

### Project Structure
1. **Data Extraction**: 
   - A Lambda function automates the daily extraction of playlist data from Spotify, storing it as JSON in S3.
2. **Data Transformation**: 
   - AWS Glue cleans, normalizes, and structures the data, outputting CSV files to S3 for analysis.
3. **Data Loading**: 
   - Transformed data is loaded into Snowflake for storage and real-time querying.
4. **Data Analysis & Visualization**: 
   - Power BI dashboards showcase trends in song popularity based on timing and other factors.

### Example Code
Here’s a snippet from our data extraction script, showcasing how we interact with the Spotify API:
```python
import boto3
from spotipy import SpotifyClientCredentials
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id='your_client_id', client_secret='your_client_secret')
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)
    results = sp.playlist_tracks('spotify_playlist_uri')
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.put_object(Bucket='your_bucket', Key='data.json', Body=json.dumps(results))
```

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-release-timing.git
   cd spotify-release-timing
   ```

2. **Install the necessary Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up AWS credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are set up in your environment to access Amazon S3, Lambda, and Glue.

4. **API Setup**:
   - Register your Spotify app to obtain the `client_id` and `client_secret`.
   - Store these credentials securely in environment variables.

5. **Run the ETL pipeline**:
   Follow the instructions in the project files to execute Lambda functions, Glue transformations, and Snowflake loading.

### Usage
To run the data extraction and transformation process:
1. Trigger the Lambda function for daily data extraction.
2. Use AWS Glue to transform and process the raw data.
3. Run the Snowpipe configuration to load data into Snowflake.
4. Open Power BI to visualize and analyze the trends.

### Visualizations
- **Song Popularity by Release Date**: Analyze how the release date impacts song popularity.
- **Song Duration vs. Popularity**: Identify trends between song length and popularity metrics.
